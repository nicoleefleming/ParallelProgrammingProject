The purpose of this assignment is to implement a parallelized version of the Jacobi iterative method to approximate
the x vector in the formula Ax = b. 
    1. For the purposes of the assignment, matrix A is assumed to be diagonally dominant, meaning it converges. Also assume matrix A has first subdiagonal and first superdiagonal are all 1's, and the main diagonal are all -2's. 
    2. The dimensions of A, x, and b will be a multiple of the number of processors used. i.e. for 4 processors 20, 100, 10,000 could be the dimesion.
    3. Use MPI methods Gather/Scatter or use a master/slave approach to complete this task. Both methods are pretty simple, but it is your prefence on which to use.
    4. Look up and famaliarize yourself with the Jacobi iterative method. 
    5. Create a function that implements the Jacobi method to approximate x values in the equation Ax = b.
    6. To test your Jacobi method is working correctly, assume the vector b is all 0's. After verifying your Jacobi method works, assume b = cos(pi * p) and solve for the vector x. 
    7. Time the program using 4, 8, and 10 processors, with dimensions of 40, 200, 1000. Then report the results for the number of processors by the dimensions in a visually appealing way(table, graph, etc.).
    8. Type up a report of your program using LaTex. 
    9. Turn in a pdf of the report, and your source code in a .zip file to canvas.
    10. Smile, you're done :)
